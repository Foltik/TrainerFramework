# TrainerFramework

A general purpose framework for creating "Trainers": programs that dynamically manipulate the memory of other running processes in order to 
change or add additional functionality not normally supported.

Includes an interpreted assembler-like DSL that makes it easy to patch functions with additional instructions, no-ops, 
trampolines; inject new executable code blocks that can be referenced with the script; and more.
